YEI_IMU
=======

Matlab code for processing Yost Technology 3D IMU

Created for EC3000 "Do Something" project.  Plots Euler angles from quaternion data coming of the YEI 3-Space sensor.  We had the 3-Space sensor with an included micro-sd card.  This processing was done after downloading the text file from the micro-SD into MATLAB.
